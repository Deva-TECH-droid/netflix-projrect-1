            Cricket is a popular team sport played globally, with variations in format and length. It involves two teams
            competing in batting, bowling, and fielding to score runs and take wickets. While Test matches can last for
            five days, shorter formats like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches offer more concise
            and exciting viewing experiences. Cricket's popularity extends beyond just the game itself, encompassing a
            rich history, traditions, and a strong emphasis on sportsmanship.
